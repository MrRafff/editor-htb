Hack The Box – Editor

This repository contains my analysis and walkthrough of the Editor machine from Hack The Box.

Overview

Editor is a security-focused lab designed to test enumeration skills, vulnerability identification, and privilege escalation techniques. The machine requires a structured approach to reconnaissance, careful analysis of exposed services, and an understanding of common web application attack vectors.

This write-up focuses on:

Systematic reconnaissance and service enumeration

Identification of the core vulnerability

Exploitation methodology

Privilege escalation process

Security lessons learned

Note: This repository does not directly disclose flags or final answers. The goal is to encourage readers to understand the methodology and reproduce the attack path independently.

Documentation

The full walkthrough and detailed explanation are available in:

The PDF includes:

Screenshots of each phase

Step-by-step technical analysis

Explanation of exploitation logic

Privilege escalation breakdown

Learning Objectives

By reviewing this material, readers should be able to:

Improve enumeration techniques

Recognize vulnerable configurations

Understand exploitation flow

Think critically about attack paths

Apply mitigation strategies
